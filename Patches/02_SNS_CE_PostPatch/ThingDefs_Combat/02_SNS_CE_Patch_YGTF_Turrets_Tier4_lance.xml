							<description>A highly advanced automatic turret that uses n Abyssal Lance as its weapon of choice. Fires at a decent rate (blazing for the likes of Abyssal Lances).

							<description>A highly volatile turret that uses a Abyssal Lance supercharged with enigmatic energy as its weapon of choice. While it takes a while to charge, it makes up for the wait by unleashing a violent volley of low-energy Eternal Fabric projectiles that are on-par with the Abyssal Lance.\n\nWhile the turret won't explode, the danger of the turret still lies in its ability to lay waste to whatever lies in its path. It has to be loaded one cell at a time.\n\nJust like the Abyssal Lance, the turret excels at extremely close and long range, but is highly inconsistent at medium ranges.</description>
