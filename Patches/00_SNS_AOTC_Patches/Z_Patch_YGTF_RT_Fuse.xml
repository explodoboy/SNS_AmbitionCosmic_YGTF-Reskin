					<description>Incredibly safe, the Abyssal Battery Gen 1 is capable of storing incredible amounts of energy at the absolute highest possible efficiency. Incredibly safe, the Abyssal Battery will never combust or explode even when damaged. It is also effectively immune to power surges, as it will simply discharge itself when a short circuit is detected.\n\nStats:\n1: Stores 10000 Watts at 100% efficiency\n2: Will dissipate 10000 Watts during short circuit (Zzztt...) events.</description>
