					<description>From the dawn of civilization, we have lived in the shadow of the Ancients, a precursor civilization of untold advancement, an empire that brought the grandest materials to our universe: Abyssal Matter. We will take the path they were unable to complete, in both our name and theirs.\n\nThis research won't discover anything on its own, but the future benefits are great.</description>

By learning what Abyssal Matter binds to and is repelled by, we can in theory make an alloy strong enough to house the elusive Abyssal Matter, even if it's just a small amount.</description>

					<description>Our current methods of developing Voidsteel is rather inefficient, as it is highly difficult to prepare for the next step of Voidsteel production while currently working on one stage. If we can devise a way to prep for a later stage of Voidsteel production, we could theoretically improve the speed of the Cosmic Forge drastically.</description>
