					<description>A highly advanced automatic turret that uses an Abyssal Lance as its weapon of choice. Fires very slowly and consumes five Abyssal Catalyst Fuel Cells per shot. Must be reloaded occasionally with Abyssal Catalyst Fuel Cells.\n\nIt is a good idea to put the turret behind plenty of cover so that enemies don't too close and cause the turret to hit itself with its own splash damage.\n\nJust like the Abyssal Lance, the turret excels at extremely close and long range, but is highly inconsistent at further ranges.</description>

					<description>A highly advanced automatic turret that uses an Abyssal Lance as its weapon of choice. Fires somewhat slowly and consumes five Abyssal Catalyst Fuel Cells per shot. It uses Abyssal Matter as coolant of sorts to increase its fire rate.

				<value>
					<description>A highly advanced automatic turret that uses an overcharged Abyssal Lance as its weapon of choice. Fires at a decent rate (blazing for the likes of Abyssal Lances) and does not require any fuel other than what is used to build it. Every three seconds it unleashes a burst of two Abyssal Lance projectiles.\n\nIt is a good idea to put the turret behind plenty of cover so that enemies don't too close and cause the turret to hit itself with its own splash damage.\n\nJust like the Abyssal Lance, the turret excels at extremely close and long range, but is highly inconsistent at further ranges.</description>

					<description>A highly volatile turret that uses a Cosmic Lance powered by an enigmatic power as its weapon of choice. While it takes a while to charge, it makes up for the wait by unleashing a violent volley of low-energy Eternium projectiles that are on-par with the Cosmic Lance.\n\nWhile the turret won't explode, the danger of the turret still lies in its ability to lay waste to whatever lies in its path.\n\nIt is a good idea to put the turret behind plenty of cover so that enemies don't too close and cause the turret to absolutely obliterate itself with its own splash damage.\n\nJust like the Cosmic Lance, the turret excels at extremely close and long range, but is highly inconsistent at medium ranges.</description>
