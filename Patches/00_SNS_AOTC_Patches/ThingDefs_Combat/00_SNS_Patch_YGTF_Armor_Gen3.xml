					<description>A pressure-sealed Abyssal Power Armor Helmet fueled by Eternal Fabric. Incredibly lightweight, tough, protective, and comfortable, this power-armor helmet is far superior to that of its predecessors in every way imaginable.\n\nThis helmet is truly arcane, and is beyond that of anything else. There are only a few dozen of these suits known of in the galaxy, most of them broken beyond repair.</description>

Incredibly lightweight, tough, protective, and comfortable, this suit of power armor is far superior to that of its previous generation in every way imaginable.
